Forecasting and demand planning can be done using time series analysis which helps in predicting future values based on historical data.
## Usecases:
1. Optimizing Inventory Management
2. Financial Planning and Budgeting
3. Customer Service and Satisfaction

## Problem Statement
Create a Python program to forecast future demand for a retail or manufacturing company. Make use of sales data for products or services to develop a program that uses time series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to predict future demand, helping the company plan production and inventory levels effectively.

## Features
- Time series analysis and visualization for understanding historical demand patterns.
- ARIMA and SARIMAX model identification and parameter selection for effective forecasting.
- Model training and evaluation using historical data.
- Seamless integration with Python for ease of use and flexibility.
